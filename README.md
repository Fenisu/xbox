To test out my gousb driver, I'm playing around with the xbox controller USB protocol.

To install this:

    go get github.com/Fenisu/xbox

It should work with:

    RAZR Onza
    Microsoft XBox Wired Controller
    Microsoft XBox One (via microusb cable), Logic3 Rock Candy for Xbox One

You'll need to re-plug the controller before you run the binary, I haven't worked out the reset yet.
